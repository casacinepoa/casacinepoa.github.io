O HOMEM QUE COPIAVA, filme da Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre, dirigido por Jorge Furtado, estreou ontem, dia 22 de abril em Nova York, no cinema Quad 3. E já está sendo resenhdo pelos críticos norte-americanos.

Stuart Klawans, do The Nation, diz o seguinte sobre o filme: "You never know when Furtado will spring on you a fantasy image, an art history reference, an ironic how-to demonstration or an animation of André's drawings. (The latter elements, directed by Allan Sieber, have a Simpsons look, except for the photomontage effects used whenever Eleanor Roosevelt shows up. André is fascinated by her.) A born film-cutter, Furtado has found a natural outlet for his talents in the character of André--a man whose ideas of the world are fragmentary, formed from whatever material he copies--and in the economic engine of André's society, which is driven by an alternating current of credence and fraud."

Segundo Stephen Holden, do New York Times: "André's dry-eyed analysis of his financial predicament offers a detailed dollars-and-cents picture of an existence one step above poverty. A major obstacle to a brighter future was his expulsion from high school after he hit a fellow student over the head with a bottle. Since then, his education has been reduced to retaining scraps of knowledge from the documents he copies."

Maitland McDonagh, do Timeout, escreveu: "Writer-director Jorge Furtado's quirky fable follows mild-mannered minimum-wage slave André (Ramos) along a highly eccentric route that leads him out of a vague fantasy world and into an unpredictable reality."

Veja a opinião do crítico do The New York Daily News: "A big hit back home, this good-humored­gem from Brazilian director Jorge Furtado manages to tackle some serious issues without sacrificing its inherently sweet nature."

O HOMEM QUE COPIAVA estará em Los Angeles a partir do dia 29, em São Francisco e Berkeley em maio, e na capital Washington no mês de junho.
